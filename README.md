<h2>Functionalities:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Inputting resistor line colors to facilitate calculations and usage</li>
  <li>Validation of inputted data</li>
  <li>Displaying calculation results in the application view</li>
  <li>Option to reset inputted values and calculation results</li>
  <li>Adding the option to select the number of bands on the resistor, such as 4-band, 5-band, etc.</li>
  <li>Adding the option to select the precision of resistance (tolerance).</li>
  <li>Option to save calculation results to history, allowing users to view and replay them.</li>
  <li>Adding the option to change the unit of resistance to other units, such as kΩ, MΩ, etc.</li>
  <li>Adding the option to choose a light or dark mode for the application interface.</li>
  <li>Displaying a graph of the current-voltage characteristic of the resistor</li>
  <li>Adding the option to select the language of the user interface, such as English, Polish, etc.</li>
